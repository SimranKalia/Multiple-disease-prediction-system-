# Multiple-disease-prediction-system-
The Multiple Disease Prediction System is a Python-based machine learning project designed to predict the likelihood of various diseases—such as diabetes, heart disease, and Parkinson's—based on user-provided medical data. The system uses pre-trained classification models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM) trained on publicly available medical datasets. Users input relevant health metrics (like blood pressure, glucose level, age, etc.), and the system analyzes the data to predict the presence or risk of specific diseases. It features a user-friendly interface (often built with Streamlit or Tkinter) and can help in early detection, aiding healthcare professionals and patients in decision-making.
